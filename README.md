According to the graph comparing the maximum vertical displacements of various bungy cords,
Cord 7 (with a cord length of 21 meters and a spring constant of 50) and Cord 8 (with a cord
length of 21 meters and a spring constant of 60) are the most effective that performs the
alternatives to a great extent. It offers the most vertical displacement and breaks through the
fully dunked threshold. Implying that it facilitates the most thrilling bungy jump possible for the
jumper.
