According to the graph comparing the maximum vertical displacements of various bungy cords,
Cord 7 (with a cord length of 21 meters and a spring constant of 50) and Cord 8 (with a cord
length of 21 meters and a spring constant of 60) are the most effective that performs the
alternatives to a great extent. It offers the most vertical displacement and breaks through the
fully dunked threshold. Implying that it facilitates the most thrilling bungy jump possible for the
jumper.

By looking at the charts, we can get an idea of when and at which velocity the jumper hits the water. Approximately 2 seconds after jumping, the jumper appears to hit the water at a speed of 18 m/s.
The jumper's maximum vertical displacement will be reduced as a result of the additional mass. In order to accommodate the additional weight, the bungy cord will need to stretch even further. As a result, the jumper will be able to reach the water's surface faster, have a slower impact velocity, and take longer to do so.
